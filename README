Textcast
--------

Textcast is some javascript code that will playback text. It came about because
I was looking for a quick way to make some screen casts for the 
<a href="http://github.com/mtvee/bgz">bgz</a> project and I wasted a whole
morning trying to find something that worked, and failed so I built
this. I just needed to record some terminal action.

The code is pretty simple and reasonably well commented I think. Pull the
files and look them over in a browser and your editor and you should be
able to suss it out.

Basically you can do your thing in the terminal and when you are done,
cut and paste it into the textarea in index.html and run it. 

Feel free to let me know if you have any thoughts on it. Hope you find it
useful!
