Textcast
--------

Textcast is some javascript code that will playback text. It came about because
I was looking for a quick way to make some screen casts for the 
http://github.com/mtvee/bgz project and I wasted a whole
morning trying to find some mac app that worked, and failed, so I built
this. For the love of all that is good and decent, I just needed to record 
some terminal action!! Sheesh!

The code is pretty simple and reasonably well commented I think. Pull the
files and look them over in a browser and your editor and you should be
able to suss it out. 

If you just want a look the bgz demo is running this 
code and you can check it out here http://j2mfk.com/projects/bugz/.

Basically you can do your thing in the terminal and when you are done,
cut and paste it into the textarea in index.html and run it. 

Do let me know if you have any thoughts on this and I hope you find it
useful!
